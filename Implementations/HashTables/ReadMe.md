A whiteboard challenge intended to help us understand data structures. 

## Challenge
Upon completion, your Hashtable should be able to handle the following:

Add an item to a hashtable.(Method name: Add(key, value))
Get a value from a key (Method name: Contains(key))
Make a hashing algorithm that will determine and set the Key of your Key/Value Pair(Method Name: GetHash(key))
Handle collisions in the event that 2 keys equal the same
